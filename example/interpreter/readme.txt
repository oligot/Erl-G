This is a simple example that demonstrates the use of the Erl-G interpreter. 
Note that while the interpreter can execute arbitrary code it cannot load
classes nor derive new types at runtime.

To run the example you have to do the following:

Run `geant install'
 
Compile the example with EiffelStudio using the file `interpreter.ecf'

Please note that the example depends only on the Erl-G runtime classes
and not on all of Erl-G and its dependencies.
