EiffelStudio 6.0 on Windows
---------------------------

Due to a technical issue, auto_test will try to locate EiffelStudio 6.1 by default. 
If you want auto_test to use EiffelStudio 6.0 instead please make sure you set the 
following variables correctly:

 - ISE_EIFFEL
 - ISE_C_COMPILER
 - ISE_PLATFORM

For example on my machine they are set to:
set ISE_EIFFEL=F:\Eiffel60
set ISE_C_COMPILER=msc
set ISE_PLATFORM=windows
